// Trees are the hiererical data structures where 
// each nodes are connected with edges and each edges 
// tells the relationship between the each node.

//Leaf Node=>with no child nodes

//Internal Node=>with atleast one child node

// Ansestor Node-> Mtlb Papa ,And Papa ke Papa.

// Descendant Node:->Opposite of Ansestors mtlb Papa 
// ke bacche ,papa ke bacche ke bacche.

//Level means Generations mtlb kitna Pidhi.

// size=No. of nodes

//No of edges = size-1;

//Height=Level-1;




//   Important properties of trees



// 1) It has no loop and circuit
// 2)It has no self loop




//  Types of trees

// 1) Generic Trees=> Means one node has many children.
// it can be more than two,three,four,five,sie etc.


// 2)Binary Trees=> One node can have 0,1,2 children only.
// It can be left child,right child or both.If one node 
// has one child then one will point to NULL,If Node has no 
// child then right,left will point to NULL.

//In binary trees every node has a value and its left child's address and right child's adress


// 3)Binary Search Trees:->Binary trees with some special property.
// like what the numerical value of node i am taking its left should be less 
// than the value of node and node's right should be greater than the node.
// Ex->i have taken a root node 8 , So,its right value should be 9,10,11,12 and 
// its left value should be 3,4,5,6,7. 


// 4)AVL trees ,Balanced  BST's



// Applications of tree data structure 
// 1)Hierarchical data structure 
// 2) Searching efficiency 
// 3)Sorting
// 4)Dynamic data 
// 5)Efficient insertion and deletion 
// 6)Easy to implement
